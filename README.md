This project was developed as part of INQbate India hackthon hosted at Kochi, India. 

This is a project for disaster management in case of floods. In case of floods, due to loss of active internet connection, people are not able to send for help. Our project helps in providing a network in case of floods. A device called a Node-MCU is used to provide an wifi network. One Node-MCU device gives a range of approximately 40-60 metres.

The above photo is a Node-MCU with a wifi driver.

In case of floods, the cluster of these devices shall be dropped with the help of drones or helicopters in the flood affected area. This will form a mesh network of devices that provide wifi services. Each of the devices is connected to a central server. This central server is present at a relief centre closest to the flood affected region. When all other networks are down, the mobiles of people trapped will automatically connect to this network. As soon as they connect, they shall be shown a form which they can fill, giving the details of their immediate needs. The location of the person is automatically recorded once the user grants permission. 

This system will help relief to be provided quickly and effectively.
